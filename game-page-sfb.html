                        While at LemonChili the main project I worked on was Super Farming Boy. A cute farming game with a fun combo mechanic for havesting crops that I loved to find new limits for. I worked alongside a very small team of programmers, artists and designers to bring this and some of their other IPs to life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was responsable for everything from bug fixing; to adding new features coming down the pipeline; to putting our current feature list through rigorous testing to find and categorise any problems before they have a chance to rear their head. After a while working for them, I was even promoted to Director for the Irish branch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At one point during my time working there, I was put in charge of an even smaller team segment to lead the begining of the development cycle for a new idea they were contemplating bringing to market. During my time leading this smaller group I had to establish what features/changes management were looking for; cut those features up into smaller tasks for use in the weekly sprint; and make sure those tasks and deadlines were met.

                        I thoroughly enjoyed my time working at LemonChili; we had a lovely team and I like to think we worked well together. Alas due to finance reasons they had to make me and the rest of the Irish cluster redundant; closing the branch I worked at. I'm greatful for the time I had there; and all the learning opptortunities and friends I made along the way. I hope somewhere out there; they're still having just as much fun as we had; working on Super Farming Boy together. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you want to give the game a try; feel free to check out our Steam page, Epic store page, or even their website through the buttons above! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It seems I had left a decent impression on them too. Seeing this letter of recommendation arriving in my email shortly after parting ways.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Good luck out there Lemon Team! Keep those fever points flowing!
