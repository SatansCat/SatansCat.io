                        My first interaction with <a href="https://www.tudublin.ie/research-innovation/research/discover-our-research/research-groups/viral/about/">VIRaL</a> (The Virtual Interactive Research Lab) was during college; where I was hired by them for a work placement. Then once I was finsihed my degree I was approached to join their team again and head up a number of reasearch and development projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During my time working for VIRaL I worked on a number of projects for many different customers; and I think the experience taught me a lot about communicating with clients, some of which were not tech savy, about the product and features they wanted us to prototype. Although I can't speak much about most of what I worked on due to confidentiality I really enjoyed the variety of the projects put before me; they always presented a new and interesting challenge and opptortunity to learn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over my period of time working there, on various Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality projects, I gained the title of Lead VR/AR Software developer. Sholdering the design and implementation of the majority of some of the project's code bases. It was a hefty responsibility; but very rewarding. Seeing the final project take shape after all our hard work, is such a fantastic feeling!

                        One of the projects I can talk about is the <a href="https://www.tudublin.ie/research-innovation/research/discover-our-research/research-groups/viral/research/research-project-3/#">Fire Simulation for the Mater Private</a> hospital. This was a VR training simulation to teach surgions and other hospital staff how to react in case of a fire in the opperating theater. The idea behind the design was that simply hearing instructions on how to deal with a fire were less effective than actually getting to "live" the scanrio out in VR and develop the necisary muscle memory to act quickly when the time comes. It tought the proper couse of action to take; but also what to prioritise in such a situation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall a very fun project to work on; and validating in ways beyond just getting to see it all work in the end. It felt good that what I was making was designed to benifit people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was sad to part ways once my contract was up; but I thoroughly enjoyed my time working there; and I hope Dr Brian Vaughan and his team are still out there making a difference.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thanks for the experience; but now it's time to light my own fire!
